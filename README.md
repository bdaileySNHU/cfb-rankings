# College Football Ranking System

A comprehensive college football ranking system using a **Modified ELO algorithm** that incorporates recruiting rankings, transfer portal activity, and returning production. Includes a REST API backend built with FastAPI.

## Features

### Modified ELO Algorithm
- **Preseason Ratings** based on:
  - 247Sports recruiting class rankings
  - Transfer portal rankings
  - Returning production percentage
- **In-Season Updates** after each game with:
  - Home field advantage (+65 points)
  - Margin of victory multiplier (capped at 2.5)
  - Conference-based multipliers (P5 vs G5, FBS vs FCS)
- **Strength of Schedule** calculations (average opponent ELO rating)

### REST API
- FastAPI backend with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- CORS support for frontend integration
- SQLite database (easily upgradable to PostgreSQL)
- Real-time ranking updates after game processing
- Historical ranking tracking by week

## ðŸ†• Real Data Integration

**NEW!** Import real 2024 college football data:

```bash
# Get free API key from https://collegefootballdata.com/key
export CFBD_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Import real teams and games
python3 import_real_data.py
```

See **[REAL_DATA_GUIDE.md](REAL_DATA_GUIDE.md)** for complete instructions.

## API Usage Monitoring

The system automatically tracks all CFBD API calls to help monitor usage against the monthly limit (1000 calls/month on the free tier).

### Features
- **Automatic tracking** of every API call (endpoint, timestamp, response time)
- **Real-time usage statistics** with percentage used and remaining calls
- **Warning thresholds** at 80%, 90%, and 95% usage (logged automatically)
- **Configurable monthly limit** via environment variable
- **Top endpoint analysis** to identify which calls are most frequent

### Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
CFBD_MONTHLY_LIMIT=1000  # Default: 1000 (free tier)
```

### Monitoring Endpoint

```bash
# Get current month's usage
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/admin/api-usage"

# Get specific month's usage
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/admin/api-usage?month=2025-01"
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "month": "2025-10",
  "total_calls": 110,
  "monthly_limit": 1000,
  "percentage_used": 11.0,
  "remaining_calls": 890,
  "average_calls_per_day": 5.79,
  "warning_level": null,
  "top_endpoints": [
    {
      "endpoint": "/teams/fbs",
      "count": 105,
      "percentage": 95.5
    }
  ],
  "last_updated": "2025-10-19T23:09:46.108954"
}
```

### Warning Levels
- **80%** - WARNING logged to console
- **90%** - WARNING logged to console
- **95%** - CRITICAL logged to console

Warnings are logged once per threshold per month to prevent spam.

## Automated Weekly Updates

The system can automatically import new game data every Sunday evening during the active football season (August - January).

### Features
- **Scheduled updates** every Sunday at 8:00 PM Eastern Time
- **Active season detection** - automatically skips updates in off-season (February - July)
- **Pre-flight checks** before each update:
  - Verifies we're in active season
  - Detects current week from CFBD API
  - Checks API usage is below 90% threshold
- **Comprehensive logging** to `/var/log/cfb-rankings/weekly-update.log`
- **Graceful error handling** with automatic retries and clear error messages

### Setup (Production)

1. **Copy systemd units to system directory:**
```bash
sudo cp deploy/cfb-weekly-update.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp deploy/cfb-weekly-update.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

2. **Create log directory:**
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/cfb-rankings
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/cfb-rankings
```

3. **Enable and start the timer:**
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable cfb-weekly-update.timer
sudo systemctl start cfb-weekly-update.timer
```

4. **Verify timer is active:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status cfb-weekly-update.timer
sudo systemctl list-timers --all | grep cfb
```

### Manual Testing

Run the weekly update script manually:
```bash
python3 scripts/weekly_update.py
```

Trigger the systemd service manually:
```bash
sudo systemctl start cfb-weekly-update.service
sudo journalctl -u cfb-weekly-update -f  # Watch logs in real-time
```

### Monitoring

Check recent update logs:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/cfb-rankings/weekly-update.log
```

Check systemd journal:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u cfb-weekly-update -n 50
```

View next scheduled run:
```bash
systemctl list-timers cfb-weekly-update.timer
```

## Scripts

The project includes several utility scripts for data management and maintenance:

### `scripts/weekly_update.py`

**Automated weekly data import** that runs every Sunday evening to import completed game results and update rankings.

**Purpose:** Keep the system up-to-date with the latest game results during the football season.

**When to run:** Automatically via systemd timer (Sunday 8PM ET) or manually when needed.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/weekly_update.py
```

**See:** Automated Weekly Updates section above for setup instructions.

---

### `scripts/generate_predictions.py`

**Generate predictions for upcoming games** using current ELO ratings before games are played.

**Purpose:** Create pre-game predictions for the Prediction Comparison feature.

**When to run:** Every Tuesday/Wednesday before the next weekend's games.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 scripts/generate_predictions.py
```

**Expected output:** "âœ… Successfully saved N predictions to database"

**See:** `docs/WEEKLY-WORKFLOW.md` for integration into weekly maintenance workflow.

---

### `scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py`

**One-time setup script** that generates predictions for past games using historical ELO ratings that existed before each game was played.

**Purpose:** Populate the Prediction Comparison feature with historically accurate predictions for analysis of prediction algorithm performance.

**When to run:** Once during initial setup, or when historical predictions are missing.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Preview changes (recommended first step)
python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --dry-run

# Run actual backfill
python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py

# Backfill specific season
python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --season 2025

# Rollback if needed
python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --delete-backfilled \
  --start-time "2025-10-27 10:00:00" --end-time "2025-10-27 10:05:00"
```

**Key features:**
- Uses historical ratings from week before each game (not current ratings)
- Automatic duplicate prevention (skips games with existing predictions)
- Dry-run mode for preview without database changes
- Rollback capability for undo operations
- Comprehensive logging and progress tracking

**See:** `docs/WEEKLY-WORKFLOW.md` "One-Time Setup: Historical Prediction Backfill" for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

## Manual Update Trigger

In addition to automated weekly updates, you can manually trigger data imports via the API. This is useful for:
- Testing the update process
- Importing mid-week data after rescheduled games
- Forcing an update outside the normal schedule

### Features
- **Async execution** - Returns immediately with a task_id, update runs in background
- **Pre-flight checks** - Same validation as automated updates:
  - Active season check (August - January)
  - Current week detection from CFBD API
  - API usage threshold check (aborts if >= 90% used)
- **Status tracking** - Poll task status to monitor progress
- **Comprehensive results** - Returns games imported, teams updated, errors
- **Admin dashboard** - View usage statistics and projections

### Usage

**1. Trigger an update:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/admin/trigger-update"
```

Returns a `task_id` immediately.

**2. Check status:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/admin/update-status/{task_id}"
```

Poll this endpoint until `status` is `completed` or `failed`.

**3. Monitor API usage:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/admin/usage-dashboard"
```

See current month usage, projections, and daily breakdown.

### Error Scenarios

**Off-season (February - July):**
```json
{
  "detail": "Cannot update during off-season (Feb-July)"
}
```

**No current week:**
```json
{
  "detail": "No current week found - season may not be active"
}
```

**API usage too high (>= 90%):**
```json
{
  "detail": "API usage at 92.5% - aborting to prevent quota exhaustion"
}
```

All endpoints are documented in the interactive API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- pip

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`):
```bash
CFBD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./cfb_rankings.db
CFBD_MONTHLY_LIMIT=1000
```

3. **Initialize database with sample data:**
```bash
python3 seed_data.py
```

This creates 33 teams and 25 games from 2 weeks of a sample season.

## Usage

### Start the API Server

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:8000`

### Interactive API Documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Predictions (NEW!)

**NEW!** Predict upcoming game outcomes using ELO-based win probability and score estimation.

### Features
- **Data-driven predictions** using Modified ELO ratings
- **Win probability percentages** for each matchup
- **Score estimates** based on rating difference
- **Confidence levels** (High/Medium/Low)
- **Prediction accuracy tracking** with historical comparison
- **AP Poll comparison** to validate ELO system performance

### Quick Start

```bash
# Get next week's predictions
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/predictions?next_week=true"

# Get predictions for specific week
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/predictions?week=8"

# Get predictions for specific team
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/predictions?team_id=1"

# Get prediction accuracy stats
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/predictions/accuracy"

# Compare ELO vs AP Poll predictions
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/predictions/comparison"
```

### Example Prediction Response

```json
{
  "game_id": 123,
  "home_team": "Georgia",
  "away_team": "Alabama",
  "week": 8,
  "season": 2025,
  "predicted_winner": "Georgia",
  "predicted_home_score": 31,
  "predicted_away_score": 24,
  "home_win_probability": 68.5,
  "away_win_probability": 31.5,
  "confidence": "Medium"
}
```

### How It Works

**Win Probability:**
```
P(home wins) = 1 / (1 + 10^((away_rating - home_rating) / 400))
```

**Score Estimation:**
- Base score: 30 points per team (historical average)
- Adjustment: Â±3.5 points per 100 rating difference
- Home field advantage: +65 rating points

**Confidence Determination:**
- **High:** Win probability > 80% or < 20%
- **Medium:** Win probability 65-80% or 20-35%
- **Low:** Win probability 35-65% (close matchup)

### Prediction Accuracy

The system automatically tracks predictions and evaluates accuracy after games complete:

- **Stored predictions:** 9 tracked predictions
- **Accuracy metrics:** Winner prediction success rate
- **Team-specific accuracy:** View accuracy for individual teams
- **AP Poll comparison:** See how ELO predictions compare to AP Poll rankings

ðŸ“– See **[docs/PREDICTIONS.md](docs/PREDICTIONS.md)** for complete prediction methodology.

## Algorithm Details

### Preseason Rating Formula
```
Preseason Rating = Base + Recruiting Bonus + Transfer Bonus + Returning Bonus

Base:
  FBS: 1500
  FCS: 1300

Recruiting Bonus (247Sports):
  Top 5:  +200
  Top 10: +150
  Top 25: +100
  Top 50: +50
  Top 75: +25

Transfer Portal Bonus:
  Top 5:  +100
  Top 10: +75
  Top 25: +50
  Top 50: +25

Returning Production Bonus:
  80%+:   +40
  60-79%: +25
  40-59%: +10
```

### In-Season ELO Calculation
```
Expected Win Probability = 1 / (1 + 10^((Opponent_Rating - Team_Rating) / 400))

Rating Change = K Ã— (Actual - Expected) Ã— MOV_Multiplier Ã— Conference_Multiplier

Where:
  K = 32 (volatility factor)
  MOV_Multiplier = min(ln(point_diff + 1), 2.5)

Conference Multipliers:
  P5 beats G5: 0.9Ã— (less gain)
  G5 beats P5: 1.1Ã— (upset bonus)
  FBS beats FCS: 0.5Ã— (minimal gain)
  FCS beats FBS: 2.0Ã— (major upset bonus)
```

### Home Field Advantage
- +65 rating points added to home team for calculation only
- Not applied to permanent rating
- Neutral site games ignore this modifier

## Sample Output

After running `seed_data.py`, you'll see rankings like:

```
RANK   TEAM                      RATING     RECORD     CONF   SOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1      Georgia                   1869.03    2-0        P5     1725.09
2      Ohio State                1850.39    2-0        P5     1649.56
3      Alabama                   1798.92    1-1        P5     1734.07
4      Notre Dame                1772.25    2-0        P5     1648.35
5      Miami                     1747.64    2-0        P5     1658.19
```

Note how Alabama at 1-1 ranks #3 due to:
- High preseason rating (elite recruiting)
- Strong schedule (SOS: 1734.07 - 3rd hardest)
- Loss to #1 Georgia (minimal rating penalty)

## Next Steps

### Frontend Development
To build a web interface, you could use:

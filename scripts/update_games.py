"""
Update Games for Future Weeks

This script imports new games from CFBD for weeks that aren't in the database yet.
Unlike import_real_data.py, this does NOT reset the database - it only adds new games.

Useful for:
- Adding games for upcoming weeks
- Refreshing game data without losing rankings/predictions

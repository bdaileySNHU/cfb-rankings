[Timer]
# Trigger every Sunday at 8:00 PM Eastern Time
#
# IMPORTANT: Systemd timers use UTC time. Convert from ET to UTC:
#   - During EDT (Mar-Nov): 8:00 PM ET = 12:00 AM UTC Monday (next day)
#   - During EST (Nov-Mar): 8:00 PM ET = 1:00 AM UTC Monday (next day)
#
# Using Mon 00:00 UTC covers EDT period (most of the CFB season)
# For EST period (late Nov - Jan), timer will run at 7:00 PM ET instead of 8:00 PM
# This is acceptable as it's close enough to the desired time.
#
# Alternative: Use two separate timer entries to handle DST:
#   OnCalendar=Sun *-03..10-* 00:00  # EDT months (March-October)
#   OnCalendar=Sun *-11..02-* 01:00  # EST months (November-February)
#
# For simplicity, using single entry:
OnCalendar=Mon 00:00

# Persistent=true ensures missed runs (e.g., system was off) will execute on next boot
Persistent=true

# Wait a bit after boot before running (gives network time to stabilize)
RandomizedDelaySec=300

Unit tests for CFBD Client

Tests cover:
- Season detection (get_current_season)
- Current week detection from API (get_current_week)
- Calendar-based week estimation (estimate_current_week)
- Labor Day calculation (_find_labor_day)
- Season start calculation (_find_season_start)
- Edge cases: off-season, week boundaries, API failures

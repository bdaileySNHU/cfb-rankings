"""
Test Data Factories using Factory Boy

These factories provide convenient test data generation for all models.
They integrate with the test database and support traits for common scenarios.

Usage:
    # Simple usage
    team = TeamFactory()
    game = GameFactory()

    # With custom attributes
    elite_team = TeamFactory(recruiting_rank=1, elo_rating=1850.0)

    # Using traits
    p5_team = TeamFactory(conference=ConferenceType.POWER_5)
    g5_team = TeamFactory(conference=ConferenceType.GROUP_5)

    # With sequences (unique names)
    team1 = TeamFactory()  # "Team 1"
    team2 = TeamFactory()  # "Team 2"

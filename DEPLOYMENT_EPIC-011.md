# EPIC-011 Production Deployment

**Status:** Ready to Deploy
**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¢ Low (Frontend-only change)
**Estimated Time:** 30 seconds

---

## Deployment Commands

Run these commands on your production server:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project directory
cd ~/Stat-urday\ Synthesis

# 2. Pull latest code from GitHub
git pull origin main

# 3. Verify the correct commit
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: "9efbc7c Fix FCS badge appearing on future FBS games (EPIC-011)"
```

**That's it!** No backend restart needed.

---

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the fix is working:

### 1. Visit a Team Page
Navigate to any team with future games:
- Example: `https://your-domain.com/frontend/team.html?id=82` (Ohio State)

### 2. Check Future Games
Look at the schedule table and verify:
- âœ… Future FBS games (like vs Penn State, vs Michigan) do NOT show "FCS" badge
- âœ… Games appear in normal gray/italic styling (future game style)
- âœ… No badges on upcoming FBS opponents

### 3. Check Past FCS Games (if any)
Once FCS games are played:
- âœ… Completed FCS games WILL show "FCS" badge
- âœ… Badge only appears after game is processed

### 4. Browser Console Check
- âœ… No JavaScript errors in browser console (F12)

---

## What Changed

**File:** `frontend/js/team.js` (1 line)

**Change:**
```javascript
// Before:
const isFCS = game.is_fcs || game.excluded_from_rankings;

// After:
const isFCS = (game.is_fcs || game.excluded_from_rankings) && isPlayed;
```

**Effect:** FCS badge now only appears on games that are BOTH excluded AND completed.

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If any issues occur:

```bash
cd ~/Stat-urday\ Synthesis
git revert HEAD
```

Then hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R).

---

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- âœ… Git pull completes without errors
- âœ… Future FBS games don't show FCS badge
- âœ… No JavaScript errors in browser
- âœ… Team pages load normally

---

**Ready to deploy!** Just run the commands above on your production server.

# EPIC-011: Fix FCS Badge Display on Future Games

**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

---

## Problem Statement

The FCS badge incorrectly appears on ALL future games, even when the opponent is an FBS team. This happens because future games are marked with `excluded_from_rankings=True` (since they haven't been played yet), and the frontend displays the FCS badge for any game with this flag.

### Current Behavior (Incorrect)
- Ohio State vs Michigan (future game) ‚Üí Shows "FCS" badge ‚ùå
- Alabama vs Tennessee (future game) ‚Üí Shows "FCS" badge ‚ùå
- Oregon vs Washington (future game) ‚Üí Shows "FCS" badge ‚ùå

### Expected Behavior
- Ohio State vs Michigan (future game) ‚Üí No badge ‚úÖ
- Alabama vs Tennessee (future game) ‚Üí No badge ‚úÖ
- Ohio State vs North Dakota State (FCS opponent) ‚Üí Shows "FCS" badge ‚úÖ

## Root Cause Analysis

The `excluded_from_rankings` flag serves TWO different purposes:

1. **Marking FCS games** - games against FCS opponents (should show badge)
2. **Marking unprocessed games** - future games that haven't been played yet (should NOT show badge)

The frontend currently shows FCS badge for ANY game with `excluded_from_rankings=True`, causing false positives.

### Code Location
**File:** `frontend/js/team.js`

The logic likely checks:
```javascript
if (game.excluded_from_rankings) {
  // Show FCS badge
}
```

---

## Solution Design

### Option 1: Use `is_processed` Flag (Recommended)
Only show FCS badge if the game is BOTH excluded AND unprocessed (or completed):

```javascript
// Show FCS badge only for actual FCS games, not future games
if (game.excluded_from_rankings && game.is_processed) {
  // Show FCS badge
}
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal change (1 line)
- Uses existing database fields
- No migration required

**Cons:**
- Logic is slightly less explicit

### Option 2: Check Opponent's `is_fcs` Flag
Look up the opponent team and check their `is_fcs` flag:

```javascript
// Show FCS badge if opponent is actually an FCS team
if (opponent.is_fcs) {
  // Show FCS badge
}
```

**Pros:**
- Most explicit and correct
- Future-proof

**Cons:**
- Requires loading opponent team data
- More API calls or data joins

### Option 3: New Database Field
Add `is_fcs_game` boolean field to `games` table, set during import:

**Pros:**
- Explicit separation of concerns
- Clearest intent

**Cons:**
- Requires database migration
- More complex implementation

## Recommended Approach

**Use Option 1** - it's the quickest fix with minimal risk.

## Implementation Stories

### Story 001: Frontend Badge Logic Fix

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] FCS badge only appears on games against actual FCS opponents
- [ ] FCS badge does NOT appear on future FBS vs FBS games
- [ ] Past FCS games still show badge correctly
- [ ] No database migration required

**Files to Modify:**
- `frontend/js/team.js` - Update badge display logic

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
if (game.excluded_from_rankings) {
  scheduleHtml += '<span class="fcs-badge">FCS</span>';
}

// AFTER (correct):
if (game.excluded_from_rankings && (game.is_processed || game.home_score > 0 || game.away_score > 0)) {
  scheduleHtml += '<span class="fcs-badge">FCS</span>';
}
```

**Testing:**
1. View team schedule with future FBS games ‚Üí No FCS badge
2. View team schedule with completed FCS games ‚Üí FCS badge appears
3. View team schedule with future FCS games ‚Üí No badge (until game is processed)

---

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to a team page with future games (e.g., Ohio State)
2. Verify future FBS games do NOT show FCS badge
3. Navigate to a team that played an FCS opponent
4. Verify completed FCS game DOES show FCS badge
5. Check multiple teams to ensure consistency

### Edge Cases
- Team with no games yet
- Team with only FCS games
- Team with mix of FBS and FCS games
- Future FCS games (shouldn't show badge until processed)

---

## Deployment

**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Modify `frontend/js/team.js`
2. Test locally
3. Git commit
4. Push to production
5. Clear browser cache and verify

**No backend restart required** - frontend-only change.

**Rollback:** Simple `git revert` if issues occur.

---

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Zero FCS badges on future FBS vs FBS games
- ‚úÖ FCS badges appear on all actual FCS games
- ‚úÖ No user reports of incorrect badges
- ‚úÖ Manual testing passes all scenarios

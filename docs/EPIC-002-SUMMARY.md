# EPIC-002 Planning Summary

**Date Created:** 2025-10-18
**Created By:** John (PM Agent)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Development

---

## üìã What Was Created

### Epic Document
**File:** `docs/epic-002-dynamic-season-management.md`

**Epic Goal:** Eliminate hardcoded season years and improve import completeness while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing workflows.

### Three User Stories

1. **Story 004:** Add Dynamic Season & Week Detection Utility
   - **File:** `docs/stories/story-004-dynamic-season-detection-utility.md`
   - **Effort:** 3-5 hours
   - **Focus:** Create utility functions for season/week auto-detection

2. **Story 005:** Remove Hardcoded Season Years & Implement Dynamic Detection
   - **File:** `docs/stories/story-005-remove-hardcoded-seasons.md`
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours
   - **Focus:** Replace all hardcoded `2025` with dynamic detection

3. **Story 006:** Add Import Validation & Completeness Checks
   - **File:** `docs/stories/story-006-import-validation-completeness.md`
   - **Effort:** 5-7 hours
   - **Focus:** Validate imports, detect missing games, report issues

**Total Estimated Effort:** 12-18 hours

## üéØ Problems Being Solved

### Problem 1: Hardcoded Season Year
**Current State:**
- Season year `2025` hardcoded in 6+ locations
- Must manually update code every year
- Easy to miss updates, causing bugs

**After EPIC-002:**
- System automatically detects current season
- No manual updates required
- Works for 2025, 2026, 2027... automatically

### Problem 2: Incomplete Game Imports
**Current State:**
- Ohio State shows 4-0 but should be 6-0
- Games silently skipped with no warning
- No way to verify import completeness

**After EPIC-002:**
- Import scripts report: "Imported 48/50 games (96%)"
- Missing games listed with reasons
- Validation catches issues immediately

### Problem 3: No Current Week Detection
**Current State:**
- User must specify max week: "Enter max week (1-6)"
- Prompt hardcoded to suggest "Week 6"
- No automatic detection of latest week

**After EPIC-002:**
- Scripts automatically detect current week from API
- User sees: "Latest completed week: 8"
- Import proceeds automatically to current week

## üìä Story Sequencing

```
Story 1: Build Utilities
   ‚Üì
Story 2: Use Utilities (Remove Hardcoded Values)
   ‚Üì
Story 3: Add Validation
```

**Why this order?**
1. Story 1 creates foundation (utility functions)
2. Story 2 uses those utilities to remove hardcoded values
3. Story 3 adds polish (validation) on top of working system

---

## üîß Technical Changes Summary

### Backend Changes
**Files Modified:**
- `cfbd_client.py` - Add `get_current_season()`, `get_current_week()`, `estimate_current_week()`
- `import_real_data.py` - Remove hardcoded `2025`, add validation
- `update_games.py` - Add auto-detection, add validation
- `main.py` - Add `/api/seasons/active` endpoint

### Frontend Changes
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/js/api.js` - Add `getActiveSeason()` method
- `frontend/games.html` - Use dynamic season from API
- `frontend/js/comparison.js` - Use dynamic season from API

### New Features
- **CLI Flags:**
  - `--season YYYY` - Override detected season
  - `--max-week N` - Override detected max week
  - `--validate-only` - Dry-run mode
  - `--strict` - Fail on validation warnings

- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/seasons/active` - Returns currently active season

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

### When EPIC-002 is Complete:

1. **No Hardcoded Years:**
   - Zero instances of `2025` in production code (tests excluded)
   - System works for any year without code changes

2. **Automatic Detection:**
   - Import scripts detect season and week automatically
   - Frontend fetches active season from backend
   - User sees detected values before import starts

3. **Data Quality:**
   - Import validation reports completeness
   - Missing games identified with reasons
   - User can verify 100% import rate

4. **Zero Breaking Changes:**
   - All 236 existing tests pass
   - Existing workflows continue to work
   - New features are opt-in via flags

5. **Documentation:**
   - `docs/UPDATE-GAME-DATA.md` updated
   - Script help text updated
   - Troubleshooting guide for import issues

---

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

### What Stays the Same:
- ‚úÖ Database schema (no migrations)
- ‚úÖ Existing API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Import script workflow
- ‚úÖ Frontend functionality
- ‚úÖ All 236 tests pass without modification

### What's Added:
- ‚ú® Dynamic season detection
- ‚ú® Automatic week detection
- ‚ú® Import validation
- ‚ú® New CLI flags (optional)
- ‚ú® New API endpoint (optional)

### What Changes:
- üîÑ Hardcoded `2025` ‚Üí Dynamic detection
- üîÑ Manual week input ‚Üí Auto-detection
- üîÑ Silent failures ‚Üí Verbose reporting

## üìà User Impact

### Before EPIC-002:
```bash
$ python3 import_real_data.py

How many weeks would you like to import?
(The 2025 season is currently through Week 6)
Enter max week (1-6): 6

Importing games...
Week 1: Ohio State defeats Minnesota 42-3
Week 2: [No games shown - silently skipped]
...
‚úì Imported 296 games
```

**User doesn't know:**
- If 296 is all games or just some
- Why Week 2 Ohio State game is missing
- If system will work next year

### After EPIC-002:
```bash
$ python3 import_real_data.py

‚úì API Connection: OK
‚úì Detected current season: 2025
‚úì Latest completed week: 8

Importing Week 1...
‚úì Week 1: Imported 50/50 games (100%)

Importing Week 2...
‚ö† Week 2: Imported 48/50 games (96%)
  Skipped:
    - Ohio State @ Kent State (Kent State not in database - FCS)
    - Alabama @ Akron (Akron not in database - FCS)

...

================================================================================
IMPORT SUMMARY
================================================================================
Total Games: 384/400 (96%)
Total Skipped: 16 (14 FCS opponents, 2 teams not found)

‚ö† WARNING: Some teams not found in database.
See skipped games above for details.
================================================================================
```

**User now knows:**
- Exact import completeness (96%)
- Why games were skipped (FCS opponents)
- System detected current season/week automatically
- System will work next year without code changes

## üéì Lessons & Best Practices

### Design Decisions Made:

1. **Opt-In Strictness:**
   - Validation warnings by default
   - Errors only with `--strict` flag
   - Prevents blocking existing workflows

2. **Graceful Fallbacks:**
   - Frontend falls back to current year if API fails
   - Scripts use calendar estimation if CFBD API down
   - System never crashes on detection failure

3. **Clear Communication:**
   - Verbose output shows what system detected
   - User confirms before import proceeds
   - Errors explain what went wrong and how to fix

4. **Zero Risk to Existing System:**
   - No database schema changes
   - No breaking API changes
   - All new code is additive only

## ‚ú® Expected Outcome

After EPIC-002 completion, the College Football Rankings system will:

1. ‚úÖ **Automatically work for future seasons** without code changes
2. ‚úÖ **Detect current week** and import all available games
3. ‚úÖ **Validate completeness** and report missing games
4. ‚úÖ **Identify data issues** before they affect rankings
5. ‚úÖ **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing workflows

**User Confidence:** Users will trust that the system has complete, accurate data because validation proves it.

**Maintenance Burden:** Eliminated annual code updates for season year changes.

**Data Quality:** Improved through validation and completeness checks.

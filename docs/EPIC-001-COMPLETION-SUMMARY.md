## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

**Frontend-Only Solution:**
- Zero backend API changes required
- Zero database schema modifications
- Leveraged existing API endpoints
- Pure JavaScript/CSS enhancement

**Key Technical Patterns:**
1. **Defensive Programming**: Null checks for scores and team data
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with existing data, gracefully handles missing data
3. **Reusable CSS**: `.game-scheduled` class used across multiple pages
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with 768px breakpoint

### Code Quality

**JavaScript:**
- Clear conditional logic with `hasScore` and `isPlayed` checks
- Defensive null checks: `if (!winner || !loser) return;`
- Consistent error handling
- No code duplication

**CSS:**
- Modular, reusable classes
- Smooth transitions for better UX
- Follows existing design system
- Mobile-responsive

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues Fixed During Development
1. **Hardcoded Season Year**: Original code had `season: 2024` hardcoded, but database had 2025 games
   - **Fix**: Changed to `season: 2025` in both `games.html` and `team.js`
   - **Impact**: Games now display correctly

2. **Missing Null Checks**: Original code assumed all games had scores
   - **Fix**: Added defensive checks `if (!winner || !loser) return;`
   - **Impact**: No more JavaScript errors with future games

3. **Missing Neutral Site Support**: Team schedule didn't show neutral site games
   - **Fix**: Added `is_neutral_site` check in location display
   - **Impact**: More accurate location information

### Current Limitations
1. **No Future Games in Database**: Current dataset only has completed games (2025 season)
   - **Impact**: Cannot visually demonstrate scheduled game styling with real data
   - **Mitigation**: Code is ready, styling is in place, tested with null checks

2. **No Date Display**: Game dates available in API but not displayed
   - **Impact**: Users don't see when scheduled games will occur
   - **Recommendation**: Future enhancement to show game dates for scheduled games

3. **Season Hardcoded**: Season still hardcoded to 2025
   - **Impact**: Will need update when moving to 2026 season
   - **Recommendation**: Make season dynamic or add season selector

## Performance Impact

- ✅ No additional API calls (uses same endpoints)
- ✅ Minimal CSS additions (~25 lines)
- ✅ JavaScript execution time unchanged

**Backend Performance:**
- ✅ Zero backend changes
- ✅ No database queries added
- ✅ No API modifications

# EPIC-017 Story 002: Add Data Validation and Safety Checks

**Epic:** EPIC-017 - Retrospective Prediction Generation
**Story Points:** 3
**Priority:** High
**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-27
**Dependencies:** EPIC-017 Story 001 (Complete)

---

## User Story

As a **system administrator**,
I want **comprehensive safety checks and validation in the backfill script**,
So that **I can preview changes before committing them, prevent data corruption, and easily rollback if predictions are incorrect**.

---

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

- **Integrates with:**
  - `scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py` (from Story 001)
  - `models.py`: Prediction model
  - `database.py`: SQLAlchemy session management
  - Python `argparse` module for command-line flags

- **Technology:** Python 3, SQLAlchemy ORM, SQLite

- **Follows pattern:**
  - Command-line argument handling from `scripts/weekly_update.py`
  - Dry-run pattern from common CLI tools
  - Logging and validation patterns from existing scripts

- **Touch points:**
  - `predictions` table for duplicate checking
  - `ranking_history` table for data completeness validation
  - `games` table for querying games to process

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Script supports `--dry-run` flag for preview mode**
   - Usage: `python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --dry-run`
   - Performs all queries and calculations
   - Shows exactly what would be written to database
   - Does NOT commit any changes
   - Outputs summary: "DRY RUN - No changes written to database"

2. **Script prevents duplicate predictions**
   - Before creating prediction, checks: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM predictions WHERE game_id = ?`
   - If count > 0, skips game and logs: "Skipping game {game_id} - prediction already exists"
   - Increments "skipped" counter in summary
   - Does not raise error (skip and continue)

3. **Script validates historical data completeness before processing**
   - For each game, verifies both home and away team have historical ratings
   - Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ranking_history WHERE team_id IN (?, ?) AND season = ? AND week = ?`
   - If any ratings missing, logs warning with team names
   - Option: `--require-complete-data` flag to abort if any data missing
   - Default: use 1500 for missing ratings and continue

4. **Script logs warnings for data anomalies**
   - Win probability outside 5-95% range: "Unusual prediction: {home_team} vs {away_team} - {win_prob}% confidence"
   - Rating outside 1000-2500 range: "Unusual rating: {team_name} has rating {rating} in week {week}"
   - Large rating difference (>500): "Large rating gap: {home_rating} vs {away_rating}"
   - All warnings logged but do not prevent processing

5. **Script provides `--delete-backfilled` flag for rollback**
   - Usage: `python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --delete-backfilled --start-time "2025-10-27 10:00:00" --end-time "2025-10-27 10:05:00"`
   - Requires both `--start-time` and `--end-time` parameters
   - Performs: `DELETE FROM predictions WHERE created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?`
   - Shows count of predictions to delete and requires confirmation: "Delete {count} predictions? (yes/no)"
   - Logs each deletion: "Deleted {count} predictions from backfill run"

6. **Script generates comprehensive summary report**
   - Total games found
   - Predictions created
   - Predictions skipped (already existed)
   - Warnings (missing data, anomalies)
   - Errors encountered
   - Duration (seconds)
   - Average time per prediction

### Quality Requirements

7. **Validation logic is covered by unit tests**
   - Test duplicate detection logic
   - Test data completeness validation
   - Test anomaly detection (win probability, ratings)
   - Test rollback query construction

8. **Command-line flags are documented**
   - `--help` shows all available flags
   - README or script docstring includes usage examples
   - Error messages guide user to correct usage

9. **Rollback procedure is tested and safe**
   - Integration test verifies rollback deletes correct predictions
   - Test confirms rollback doesn't delete other predictions
   - Requires explicit confirmation (no accidental deletions)

## Technical Notes

### Command-Line Interface

**Script Signature:**
```bash
python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --dry-run                  Preview changes without writing to database
  --require-complete-data    Abort if any historical ratings are missing
  --delete-backfilled        Delete predictions from previous backfill run
  --start-time DATETIME      Start time for rollback (required with --delete-backfilled)
  --end-time DATETIME        End time for rollback (required with --delete-backfilled)
  --season YEAR              Process only specific season (default: all seasons)
  --week WEEK                Process only specific week (default: all weeks)
  --help                     Show this help message
```

### Implementation Pattern

**Argparse Setup:**
```python
import argparse

def parse_arguments():
    """Parse command-line arguments."""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='Backfill historical predictions using historical ELO ratings',
        formatter_class=argparse.RawDescriptionHelpFormatter,
        epilog="""
Examples:
  # Preview what would be created (no changes)
  python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --dry-run

  # Backfill all historical predictions
  python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py

  # Backfill only 2025 season, Week 5
  python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --season 2025 --week 5

  # Rollback predictions created between specific times
  python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --delete-backfilled \\
    --start-time "2025-10-27 10:00:00" --end-time "2025-10-27 10:05:00"
        """
    )

    parser.add_argument('--dry-run', action='store_true',
                        help='Preview changes without writing to database')
    parser.add_argument('--require-complete-data', action='store_true',
                        help='Abort if any historical ratings are missing')
    parser.add_argument('--delete-backfilled', action='store_true',
                        help='Delete predictions from previous backfill run')
    parser.add_argument('--start-time', type=str,
                        help='Start time for rollback (format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS")')
    parser.add_argument('--end-time', type=str,
                        help='End time for rollback (format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS")')
    parser.add_argument('--season', type=int,
                        help='Process only specific season')
    parser.add_argument('--week', type=int,
                        help='Process only specific week')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Validate rollback arguments
    if args.delete_backfilled:
        if not args.start_time or not args.end_time:
            parser.error('--delete-backfilled requires both --start-time and --end-time')

    return args
```

**Duplicate Check:**
```python
def prediction_exists(db, game_id: int) -> bool:
    """
    Check if a prediction already exists for a game.

    Args:

---

## Risk and Compatibility Check

### Minimal Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Accidental deletion of production predictions during rollback

**Mitigation:**
- Require explicit `--delete-backfilled` flag
- Require both `--start-time` and `--end-time` parameters
- Show count of predictions to delete before executing
- Require "yes" confirmation (not just Enter key)
- Log all deletions with timestamps
- Dry-run mode allows testing rollback query first

**Rollback for Rollback:**
Database backups should be created before running backfill script:
```bash
# Backup database before backfill
cp cfb_rankings.db cfb_rankings_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db

# Run backfill
python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py

# If needed, restore backup
cp cfb_rankings_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db cfb_rankings.db
```

### Compatibility Verification

- âœ… **No breaking changes to existing APIs:** Script is standalone, no API changes
- âœ… **Database changes are additive only:** Only adds predictions, deletions are explicit
- âœ… **UI changes follow existing design patterns:** No UI changes
- âœ… **Performance impact is negligible:** Validation adds minimal overhead

---

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation

- âœ… **Story can be completed in one development session:** Adding flags and validation to existing script, 2-3 hours work
- âœ… **Integration approach is straightforward:** Standard argparse and validation patterns
- âœ… **Follows existing patterns exactly:** Command-line flag handling matches weekly_update.py
- âœ… **No design or architecture work required:** All patterns established

### Clarity Check

- âœ… **Story requirements are unambiguous:** Each flag has clear behavior specification
- âœ… **Integration points are clearly specified:** Extends Story 001 script
- âœ… **Success criteria are testable:** All criteria have objective pass/fail conditions
- âœ… **Rollback approach is simple:** Standard SQL DELETE with timestamp range

```

### Manual Test Scenarios

1. **Dry Run Preview:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --dry-run
   # Verify: Shows what would be created, no database changes
   ```

2. **Duplicate Prevention:**
   ```bash
   # Run twice
   python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py
   python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py
   # Verify: Second run skips all games (already have predictions)
   ```

3. **Rollback:**
   ```bash
   # Backfill and note start/end times
   python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py

   # Rollback
   python3 scripts/backfill_historical_predictions.py --delete-backfilled \
     --start-time "2025-10-27 10:00:00" --end-time "2025-10-27 10:05:00"
   # Verify: Requires "yes" confirmation, deletes correct predictions
   ```

# EPIC-008 Story 002: Add Update Logic for When Scores Become Available

**Epic:** EPIC-008 - Future Game Imports for Predictions Feature
**Story:** 002 of 003
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

## User Story

As a **system administrator**,
I want **the import script to update scheduled games when scores become available instead of creating duplicates**,
So that **the database stays clean and ELO ratings are calculated correctly for newly-completed games**.

---

## Story Context

### Problem Being Solved

After Story 001, future games are imported with `home_score = 0` and `away_score = 0`. However, when those games are played and scores become available, the current import logic will:

1. Try to insert the game again (with real scores)
2. Either create a duplicate game OR skip it (if duplicate check exists)
3. **NOT update the existing game with the new scores**

This means:
- Future games remain with 0-0 scores forever (never updated)
- ELO ratings are never calculated for those games
- Database may contain duplicate games (same matchup, same week, different records)
- Weekly rankings don't reflect games that were recently completed

### Existing System Integration

- **Integrates with:** `import_real_data.py` import script (modified in Story 001)
- **Technology:** Python 3, SQLAlchemy ORM, SQLite database
- **Touch points:**
  - `models.py` - `Game` model with unique key (home_team_id, away_team_id, week, season)
  - `database.py` - database session management
  - `ranking_service.py` - ELO processing (should run after scores updated)

### Why This Matters

The import script should be **idempotent** - meaning it can run multiple times safely:
- Week 12 Monday: Import future games for Week 13 (scores = 0-0)
- Week 13 Monday: Re-import Week 13 with real scores (UPDATE existing games, don't duplicate)
- Week 14 Monday: Re-import Week 13 again (no changes, already processed)

This enables:
- Weekly automated imports without manual cleanup
- Self-healing data (if a game was missed, next import catches it)
- Seamless transition from "scheduled" to "completed" status

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Upsert Logic (Insert or Update):**
   - Before inserting a game, check if it already exists
   - Unique game identifier: (home_team_id, away_team_id, week, season)
   - If exists with scores = 0-0, UPDATE with new scores
   - If exists with real scores, SKIP (already processed)
   - If doesn't exist, INSERT new game

2. **Update Behavior:**
   - When updating a future game with real scores:
     - Set `home_score` and `away_score` to real values
     - Set `is_processed = False` (will trigger ELO calculation)
     - Set `excluded_from_rankings` based on FCS status (not always True)
     - Keep existing `game_id`, `created_at`, and other metadata
   - After update, game should be processed for ELO ratings

3. **Duplicate Prevention:**
   - No duplicate games in database after running import multiple times
   - Query: `SELECT home_team_id, away_team_id, week, season, COUNT(*) FROM games GROUP BY 1,2,3,4 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` returns 0 rows
   - Import can run weekly without creating data chaos

4. **Logging and Visibility:**
   - Import script logs distinguish: "Inserted new game" vs "Updated game scores"
   - Import summary shows count of games updated
   - Console output clearly indicates: "Updated game: Team A @ Team B -> 35-28"

### Quality Requirements

5. **Data Integrity:**
   - No data loss during updates (existing game metadata preserved)
   - ELO ratings calculated correctly for updated games
   - Game IDs remain stable (no deletion and re-insertion)
   - Foreign key relationships maintained

6. **Performance:**
   - Update logic adds <1 second to total import time
   - Database queries optimized (index on unique key)
   - Batch operations where possible

7. **Code Quality:**
   - Update logic is clear and well-commented
   - Edge cases handled (NULL scores, partial data, etc.)
   - Error handling for database constraints
   - Rollback on failure

---

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Modify import_games() Function - Upsert Logic

**Add Upsert Logic (replaces simple existence check):**

```python
# After getting team objects and determining FCS status...
# OLD CODE (Story 001):
# existing = db.query(Game).filter(
#     Game.home_team_id == home_team.id,
#     Game.away_team_id == away_team.id,
#     Game.week == week,
#     Game.season == year
# ).first()
# if existing:
#     continue

# NEW CODE (Story 002):
existing_game = db.query(Game).filter(
    Game.home_team_id == home_team.id,
    Game.away_team_id == away_team.id,
    Game.week == week,
    Game.season == year
).first()

if existing_game:
    # Game exists - decide whether to update, skip, or error
    if is_future_game:
        # Still a future game (no scores yet) - skip
        # This can happen if we re-import the same future week
        continue

    # Game now has scores - check if we should update
    if existing_game.home_score == 0 and existing_game.away_score == 0:
        # Future game that now has scores - UPDATE IT
        print(f"    Updating game: {game_desc} -> {home_score}-{away_score}")

        existing_game.home_score = home_score
        existing_game.away_score = away_score
        existing_game.is_neutral_site = game_data.get('neutralSite', False)
        existing_game.excluded_from_rankings = is_fcs_game  # Update based on actual FCS status
        existing_game.game_date = parse_game_date(game_data)

        # Mark as unprocessed so ELO calculation runs
        existing_game.is_processed = False

        db.commit()
        db.refresh(existing_game)

        # Now process the game for ELO ratings (if FBS vs FBS)
        if not is_fcs_game:
            result = ranking_service.process_game(existing_game)
            winner = result['winner_name']
            loser = result['loser_name']
            score = result['score']
            print(f"      Processed: {winner} defeats {loser} {score}")

        week_updated += 1
        total_updated += 1
        continue

    elif existing_game.is_processed:
        # Already processed - skip
        continue
    else:
        # Has scores but not processed yet - process it
        if not is_fcs_game:
            result = ranking_service.process_game(existing_game)
            week_imported += 1
            total_imported += 1
        continue

# Game doesn't exist - INSERT NEW GAME
# (This is the existing logic from Story 001)
is_neutral = game_data.get('neutralSite', False)

if is_future_game:
    excluded_from_rankings = True  # Safety: future games not ranked
else:
    excluded_from_rankings = is_fcs_game  # Existing logic for completed games

game = Game(
    home_team_id=home_team.id,
    away_team_id=away_team.id,
    home_score=home_score,
    away_score=away_score,
    week=week,
    season=year,
    is_neutral_site=is_neutral,
    excluded_from_rankings=excluded_from_rankings,
    is_processed=False,
    game_date=parse_game_date(game_data)
)

db.add(game)
db.commit()
db.refresh(game)

# Process for ELO if completed FBS vs FBS game
if not is_future_game and not is_fcs_game:
    result = ranking_service.process_game(game)
    winner = result['winner_name']
    loser = result['loser_name']
    score = result['score']
    print(f"    {winner} defeats {loser} {score}")
    week_imported += 1
    total_imported += 1
elif is_future_game:
    print(f"    {game_desc} (scheduled - not ranked)")
    future_games_imported += 1
else:
    # FCS game
    fcs_opponent = away_team if home_is_fbs else home_team
    fbs_team_obj = home_team if home_is_fbs else away_team
    print(f"    {fbs_team_obj.name} vs {fcs_opponent.name} (FCS - not ranked)")
    fcs_games_imported += 1
```

### 2. Add Update Tracking

```python
# At the beginning of import_games()
total_imported = 0
fcs_games_imported = 0
future_games_imported = 0
total_updated = 0  # NEW - track updates
total_skipped = 0
# ... rest of counters

# In the week loop
week_imported = 0
week_skipped = 0
week_updated = 0  # NEW - track updates per week
```

### 3. Update Import Summary

```python
# Print final import summary
print("\n" + "="*80)
print("IMPORT SUMMARY")
print("="*80)
print(f"Total FBS Games Imported: {total_imported}")
print(f"Total FCS Games Imported: {fcs_games_imported}")
print(f"Total Future Games Imported: {future_games_imported}")
print(f"Total Games Updated: {total_updated}")  # NEW
print(f"Total Games Skipped: {total_skipped}")
# ... rest of summary

# Print week summary (per week)
print(f"\n  Week {week} Summary:")
print(f"    Imported: {week_imported} games")
if week_updated > 0:
    print(f"    Updated: {week_updated} games")  # NEW
if week_skipped > 0:
    print(f"    Skipped: {week_skipped} games")
```

### 4. Optional: Add Database Unique Constraint

To prevent duplicates at the database level:

```python
# In models.py - add to Game model
from sqlalchemy import UniqueConstraint

class Game(Base):
    """Game model"""
    __tablename__ = "games"

    # ... existing fields ...

    __table_args__ = (
        UniqueConstraint(
            'home_team_id', 'away_team_id', 'week', 'season',
            name='uq_game_matchup_week_season'
        ),
    )
```

**Note:** Adding this constraint requires a database migration:

```bash
# This would require Alembic or manual migration
# For SQLite without Alembic, can create new table and copy data
# May be out of scope for this story - recommend as future enhancement
```

---

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Initial Future Game Import:**
   ```bash
   # Import future games (Week 14 before it's played)
   python3 import_real_data.py --season 2025 --max-week 14

   # Verify future games exist
   sqlite3 cfb_rankings.db
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE week = 14 AND home_score = 0;
   # Should return >0

   # Note the count for later comparison
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games;
   # e.g., 800 games total
   ```

2. **Test Game Update (Simulate Scores Available):**
   ```bash
   # Manually update a game to have real scores in test data
   # OR wait for real scores to be available in CFBD API
   # OR edit CFBD response in test

   # Re-run import for the same week
   python3 import_real_data.py --season 2025 --max-week 14

   # Verify games were UPDATED not DUPLICATED
   sqlite3 cfb_rankings.db
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games;
   # Should still be 800 (no new games added)

   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE week = 14 AND home_score = 0;
   # Should be 0 (all updated with real scores)

   # Check for duplicates
   SELECT home_team_id, away_team_id, week, COUNT(*)
   FROM games
   WHERE week = 14
   GROUP BY 1,2,3
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   # Should return 0 rows
   ```

3. **Test ELO Processing After Update:**
   ```bash
   # After updating games, verify ELO ratings changed
   sqlite3 cfb_rankings.db
   SELECT team_name, elo_rating FROM teams ORDER BY elo_rating DESC LIMIT 10;
   # Rankings should reflect the newly-completed games

   # Verify updated games are marked as processed
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE week = 14 AND is_processed = 1;
   # Should be >0 (updated games were processed)
   ```

4. **Test Idempotency (Run Import Multiple Times):**
   ```bash
   # Run import 3 times in a row
   python3 import_real_data.py --season 2025 --max-week 14
   python3 import_real_data.py --season 2025 --max-week 14
   python3 import_real_data.py --season 2025 --max-week 14

   # Verify no duplicates created
   sqlite3 cfb_rankings.db
   SELECT home_team_id, away_team_id, week, COUNT(*)
   FROM games
   GROUP BY 1,2,3
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   # Should return 0 rows

   # Verify game count unchanged
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games;
   # Should be same as before (e.g., 800)
   ```

5. **Test Import Summary:**
   ```bash
   # First import (future games)
   python3 import_real_data.py --season 2025 --max-week 14
   # Summary should show: "X future games imported"

   # Second import (with scores)
   python3 import_real_data.py --season 2025 --max-week 14
   # Summary should show: "X games updated"
   # NOT "X games imported" (they were updated, not inserted)
   ```

### Expected Behavior

**Scenario 1: First import (future games)**
```
Week 14...
  Importing future game: Alabama @ Georgia
  Importing future game: Ohio State @ Michigan
  ...
Week 14 Summary:
  Future Games Imported: 50
```

**Scenario 2: Second import (scores now available)**
```
Week 14...
  Updating game: Alabama @ Georgia -> 35-28
    Processed: Alabama defeats Georgia 35-28
  Updating game: Ohio State @ Michigan -> 42-38
    Processed: Ohio State defeats Michigan 42-38
  ...
Week 14 Summary:
  Games Updated: 50
  Games Imported: 0
```

**Scenario 3: Third import (already processed)**
```
Week 14...
  (no output - all games already processed)
Week 14 Summary:
  Games Imported: 0
  Games Updated: 0
  Games Skipped: 50
```

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks

1. **Duplicate games created due to missing unique constraint**
   - **Mitigation:** Upsert logic checks existence before inserting
   - **Mitigation:** Testing includes duplicate detection queries
   - **Mitigation:** Future enhancement: Add database unique constraint
   - **Rollback:** Delete duplicates manually, fix import script, re-run

2. **Data loss when updating games**
   - **Mitigation:** Use SQLAlchemy update (doesn't delete and re-insert)
   - **Mitigation:** Preserve all fields except scores and flags
   - **Mitigation:** Commit after each game (not batch) for safety
   - **Rollback:** Restore database from backup

3. **ELO corruption if updated games processed incorrectly**
   - **Mitigation:** Use same `process_game()` logic as initial import
   - **Mitigation:** Only process if `is_fbs_game` (not FCS matchups)
   - **Mitigation:** Testing includes ELO validation
   - **Rollback:** Restore database from backup, re-import clean data

4. **Performance degradation from existence checks**
   - **Mitigation:** Index on (home_team_id, away_team_id, week, season)
   - **Mitigation:** Query optimization (filter by season and week first)
   - **Impact:** Low - typical import has <100 games to check
   - **Note:** Database already has indexes on team foreign keys

### Rollback Plan

```bash
# If update logic causes issues:

# 1. Revert code changes
git checkout HEAD~1 import_real_data.py

# 2. Restore database from backup (if duplicates/corruption)
cp cfb_rankings.db.backup-YYYYMMDD cfb_rankings.db

# 3. Re-import clean data
python3 import_real_data.py --season 2025

# 4. Verify no duplicates
sqlite3 cfb_rankings.db
SELECT home_team_id, away_team_id, week, COUNT(*)
FROM games GROUP BY 1,2,3 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
# Should return 0 rows

# 5. Verify rankings correct
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rankings | jq '.[:10]'
```

## Files Modified

- `import_real_data.py` (~50 lines modified)
  - Lines ~286-350: Replace simple existence check with upsert logic
  - Lines ~220-230: Add `total_updated` and `week_updated` counters
  - Lines ~352-376: Update import summary to show updated games
  - Error handling for database constraints

**Optional:**
- `models.py` (~5 lines added)
  - Add `UniqueConstraint` to `Game` model (prevents duplicates at database level)
  - Requires database migration (out of scope for this story)

**Total:** ~50 lines modified/added

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- EPIC-008 Story 001 (Future game import) - must be complete first
- Existing `Game` model with `is_processed` flag
- Existing `ranking_service.process_game()` method

**Blocks:**
- EPIC-008 Story 003 (Testing & Documentation)
- Weekly automated import workflow

---

## Notes

- **Database Unique Constraint:** Adding a unique constraint to the `Game` table would prevent duplicates at the database level, but requires a migration. This is recommended as a future enhancement but not required for this story (upsert logic is sufficient).

- **Performance:** The existence check adds a database query per game, but this is negligible:
  - Typical import: 50-100 games
  - Query time: <5ms per game (with indexes)
  - Total overhead: <500ms (acceptable)

- **Batch Updates:** Current implementation updates games one at a time (commit per game). This is safer (atomic) but slower. Future enhancement could batch updates for better performance.

- **Update Logic Edge Cases:**
  - Game exists with scores but `is_processed = False`: Process it (catch missed games)
  - Game exists with scores and `is_processed = True`: Skip it (already done)
  - Game exists with scores = 0-0: Update with new scores (main case)
  - Game doesn't exist: Insert as normal (first-time import)

- **FCS Status:** When updating a future game, we re-evaluate `is_fcs_game` because:
  - At import time (future), we might not know opponent details
  - At update time (scores available), we know the actual opponent
  - This ensures `excluded_from_rankings` is accurate

---

## Development Record

**Story Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-22
**Developer:** Claude Code (Dev Agent - James)

### Changes Implemented

**File Modified:** `import_real_data.py` (~55 lines modified/added)

1. **Added update tracking counters** (lines 249, 268)
   ```python
   total_updated = 0  # EPIC-008 Story 002: Track updated games
   week_updated = 0   # Track updated games per week
   ```

2. **Replaced simple existence check with comprehensive upsert logic** (lines 314-369)
   - Check if game already exists by unique key (home_team_id, away_team_id, week, season)
   - **If game is still future (no scores):** Skip (avoid re-importing same future week)
   - **If game has scores and existing record is 0-0:** UPDATE with new scores
     - Updates: home_score, away_score, is_neutral_site, excluded_from_rankings, game_date
     - Sets `is_processed = False` to trigger ELO calculation
     - Processes game for ELO ratings (if FBS vs FBS)
     - Increments update counters
   - **If game already processed:** Skip (already done)
   - **If game has scores but not processed:** Process it
   - **If game doesn't exist:** INSERT new game (existing logic)

3. **Updated week summary** (lines 435-436)
   ```python
   if week_updated > 0:  # EPIC-008 Story 002
       print(f"    Updated: {week_updated} games")
   ```

4. **Updated final import summary** (line 447)
   ```python
   print(f"Total Games Updated: {total_updated}")  # EPIC-008 Story 002
   ```

5. **Updated return dictionary** (line 473)
   ```python
   "games_updated": total_updated,  # EPIC-008 Story 002
   ```

### Testing Results

✅ **Idempotency Test:**
- Ran import twice with identical data
- **Game count before:** 1357
- **Game count after:** 1357 (unchanged)
- **Total Games Updated:** 0 (expected - no scores changed)
- **Result:** ✅ PASS - No duplicates created

✅ **Duplicate Detection:**
- Query: `SELECT ... HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`
- **Result:** 0 rows (no duplicates)
- **Result:** ✅ PASS - Upsert logic prevents duplicates

✅ **Code Validation:**
- Python syntax check: ✅ PASS
- No import errors: ✅ PASS
- API server starts successfully: ✅ PASS

### Upsert Logic Flow

```
For each game from CFBD API:
  ├─ Check if game exists in DB by (home_team, away_team, week, season)
  │
  ├─ IF EXISTS:
  │  ├─ If current game is future (no scores): SKIP
  │  ├─ If existing has scores=0-0 AND new has scores: UPDATE
  │  │  ├─ Set new scores
  │  │  ├─ Mark is_processed=False
  │  │  ├─ Process for ELO (if FBS vs FBS)
  │  │  └─ Increment update counters
  │  ├─ If already processed: SKIP
  │  └─ If has scores but not processed: PROCESS
  │
  └─ IF NOT EXISTS: INSERT NEW GAME
     ├─ Create Game object
     ├─ Add to database
     └─ Process for ELO (if completed FBS vs FBS)
```

### Expected Behavior Examples

**Scenario 1: First import (future games)**
```
Week 9...
  Found future game: Alabama @ Georgia
  Alabama @ Georgia (scheduled - not ranked)

Total Future Games Imported: 50
Total Games Updated: 0
```

**Scenario 2: Second import (scores now available)**
```
Week 9...

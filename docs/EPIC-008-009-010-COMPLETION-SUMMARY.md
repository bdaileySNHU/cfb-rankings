# EPICs 008-010: Completion Summary

**Status:** ✅ **ALL COMPLETE**
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-21
**Total Effort:** ~18 hours

---

## EPIC-008: Future Game Imports

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 6-9 hours

### Summary
Modified import logic to import scheduled/future games (without scores yet) into the database, enabling the predictions feature to show upcoming Top 25 matchups instead of only leftover FBS vs FCS games.

### Key Deliverables
✅ Import logic modified to import games with 0-0 scores
✅ Future games marked as `is_processed = False`
✅ Upsert logic prevents duplicate games
✅ Games update correctly when scores become available
✅ Database now contains 2 future games

### Technical Implementation
- Modified `scripts/import_real_data.py` to import future games
- Set `home_score = 0`, `away_score = 0` for future games
- Set `is_processed = False` to prevent ELO processing
- Added upsert logic to update games when scores added
- Preserved existing behavior for completed games

### Evidence of Completion
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE home_score = 0 AND away_score = 0;
-- Returns: 2 future games
```

### Stories Completed
- ✅ Story 001: Modify import logic for future games
- ✅ Story 002: Add upsert logic for score updates
- ✅ Story 003: Testing and validation

## EPIC-009: Prediction Accuracy Tracking

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** 12-16 hours

### Summary
Implemented storage and tracking of predictions when games are upcoming, then comparing them to actual results after games complete. Displays prediction history and accuracy statistics.

### Key Deliverables
✅ `Prediction` database model (9 records stored)
✅ `create_and_store_prediction()` function
✅ `/api/predictions/accuracy` endpoint
✅ `/api/predictions/accuracy/team/{team_id}` endpoint
✅ `/api/predictions/stored` endpoint
✅ Prediction evaluation logic
✅ Frontend integration in team pages

### Technical Implementation
**Database:**
- New `Prediction` model in models.py (line 196)
- Fields: game_id, predicted_winner_id, predicted_scores, win_probability, was_correct

**Backend:**
- `create_and_store_prediction()` in ranking_service.py
- `evaluate_prediction_accuracy()` function
- Prediction accuracy calculation endpoints

**Frontend:**
- Team pages show prediction vs actual
- Prediction accuracy display

### Evidence of Completion
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM predictions;
-- Returns: 9 stored predictions

SELECT * FROM predictions LIMIT 1;
-- Shows: game_id, predicted_winner_id, scores, probability, was_correct
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/predictions/accuracy` - Overall accuracy stats
- `GET /api/predictions/accuracy/team/{id}` - Team-specific accuracy
- `GET /api/predictions/stored` - All stored predictions

### Stories Completed
- ✅ Story 001: Prediction model and storage logic
- ✅ Story 002: Accuracy evaluation and API endpoints
- ✅ Story 003: Frontend display of accuracy

## EPIC-010: AP Poll Comparison

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Priority:** Medium-High
**Effort:** 10-14 hours

### Summary
Implemented comparison between ELO prediction accuracy and AP Poll "predictions" (higher-ranked team should win) to validate that the ELO system provides superior predictive performance.

### Key Deliverables
✅ `APPollRanking` database model (175 records!)
✅ AP Poll data collection from CFBD API
✅ AP-implied prediction calculation
✅ `/api/predictions/comparison` endpoint
✅ `comparison.html` frontend page
✅ `comparison.js` with comparison logic

### Technical Implementation
**Database:**
- New `APPollRanking` model in models.py (line 242)
- 175 AP Poll ranking records stored
- Fields: season, week, rank, team_id, first_place_votes, points

**Backend:**
- `get_ap_prediction_for_game()` function
- Comparison stats calculation
- AP Poll data fetching from CFBD API

**Frontend:**
- `comparison.html` page for side-by-side display
- `comparison.js` with visualization logic
- Charts showing accuracy over time
- Tables showing breakdown by conference, ranking scenarios

### Evidence of Completion
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ap_poll_rankings;
-- Returns: 175 AP Poll records

SELECT poll_type, COUNT(*) FROM ap_poll_rankings GROUP BY poll_type;
-- Shows: AP Top 25 rankings by week
```

### API Endpoint
```bash
GET /api/predictions/comparison?season=2024
```

**Response includes:**
- ELO accuracy percentage
- AP accuracy percentage
- Games where systems disagreed
- Breakdown by conference, week, ranking scenarios
- ELO advantage metrics

### Stories Completed
- ✅ Story 001: AP Poll data collection and storage
- ✅ Story 002: AP prediction calculation and comparison analytics
- ✅ Story 003: Frontend comparison dashboard

# EPIC-007 Story 001: Implement Prediction Algorithm and API Endpoint

**Epic:** EPIC-007 - Game Predictions for Next Week
**Story:** 001 of 003
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours

---

## User Story

As a **backend developer**,
I want **a prediction algorithm and API endpoint that generates game predictions based on ELO ratings**,
So that **the system can provide data-driven predictions for upcoming games to users**.

---

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

- **Integrates with:** Existing ELO rating system and `Game`, `Team`, `Season` models
- **Technology:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy ORM, SQLite database
- **Follows pattern:** Similar to `/api/rankings` and `/api/games` endpoints in `main.py`
- **Touch points:**
  - `Team.elo_rating` field for current team strength
  - `Game` table for unprocessed games (`is_processed = False`)
  - `Season.current_week` for determining "next week"
  - Existing ELO calculation logic in `cfb_elo_ranking.py` (reverse application)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Prediction Algorithm:**
   - Uses existing ELO ratings to calculate win probability using standard formula: `1 / (1 + 10^((opponent_rating - team_rating) / 400))`
   - Applies home field advantage (+65 points) unless neutral site
   - Estimates scores based on ELO difference (rating_diff / 100 * 3.5 points per team)
   - Returns predicted winner, predicted scores, and win probabilities
   - Validates predictions (both teams exist, have valid ratings, game is unprocessed)

2. **API Endpoint `/api/predictions`:**
   - Accepts query parameters:
     - `week` (optional): Filter predictions for specific week
     - `team_id` (optional): Filter predictions involving specific team
     - `next_week` (optional, default=true): Only show next week's games
   - Returns array of prediction objects with:
     - Game details (game_id, teams, week, season, date, is_neutral_site)
     - Predicted winner (team name)
     - Predicted scores (home and away)
     - Win probabilities (home and away percentages)
     - Confidence level (High/Medium/Low based on win probability margin)
   - Responds in <500ms for typical week (10-50 games)
   - Returns 200 status with empty array if no upcoming games
   - Returns 400 if invalid parameters provided

3. **Service Layer Method:**
   - Create `generate_predictions()` method in `ranking_service.py`
   - Accepts database session and filter parameters
   - Queries unprocessed games efficiently (single query with joins)
   - Applies prediction algorithm to each game
   - Returns structured prediction data

### Integration Requirements

4. **Existing ELO calculation logic** continues to work unchanged (no modifications to game processing)
5. **New endpoint follows existing FastAPI patterns** (uses Depends(get_db), OpenAPI docs auto-generated)
6. **Integration with database** uses existing models (no schema changes)

### Quality Requirements

7. **Unit tests** cover:
   - Win probability calculation (known ELO differences → expected probabilities)
   - Score estimation logic (rating differences → reasonable score predictions)
   - Validation logic (invalid inputs rejected)
   - Edge cases (neutral site, FCS games, missing data)

8. **Integration tests** cover:
   - `/api/predictions` endpoint with various filter combinations
   - Empty result handling (no upcoming games)
   - Error handling (invalid week, non-existent team_id)

9. **No regression** in existing functionality:
   - Existing endpoints still work (`/api/rankings`, `/api/games`, `/api/stats`)
   - Game processing still updates ELO ratings correctly
   - Database queries remain performant

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risk
Prediction algorithm produces unrealistic scores or probabilities, reducing user trust.

### Mitigation
- Use proven ELO formula (same as existing game processing)
- Validate scores are reasonable (0-150 range)
- Test with known rating differences to verify expected probabilities
- Include confidence levels to set user expectations
- Document that predictions are estimates, not guarantees

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# Comment out the endpoint in main.py
# Remove or comment this section:
# @app.get("/api/predictions", ...)
# def get_predictions(...):
#     ...

# Restart Gunicorn
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
```

---

## Files Modified

- `ranking_service.py` (~60 lines added)
- `schemas.py` (~20 lines added)
- `main.py` (~25 lines added)
- `tests/unit/test_predictions.py` (~80 lines new file)
- `tests/integration/test_predictions_api.py` (~60 lines new file)

**Total:** ~245 lines of new code + tests

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- Existing `Team`, `Game`, `Season` models
- Existing ELO rating system
- Current week tracking (EPIC-006)

**Blocks:**
- EPIC-007 Story 002 (Frontend Display)

---

## Notes

- Prediction algorithm is intentionally simple (ELO-based) for this story
- Future enhancements could incorporate offensive/defensive stats for more accurate scores
- Score estimation formula may need tuning based on historical accuracy analysis
- Consider caching predictions if performance becomes an issue (unlikely for <50 games)

## Dev Agent Record

### Status
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Review

### Agent Model Used
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Implementation Summary

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-21

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Added prediction functions to `ranking_service.py` as standalone functions (not part of RankingService class)
2. Implemented `generate_predictions()` with full filtering support (week, team_id, next_week, season)
3. Implemented `_calculate_game_prediction()` using standard ELO formula for win probability
4. Implemented `_validate_prediction_teams()` for validation
5. Added `GamePrediction` Pydantic schema to `schemas.py`
6. Added `/api/predictions` endpoint to `main.py` with comprehensive documentation
7. Created 15 unit tests covering all edge cases
8. Created 14 integration tests for API endpoint
9. All 318 tests pass (100% success rate, no regressions)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Prediction functions are standalone (not class methods) for simplicity and modularity
- Home field advantage (+65 points) applied consistently with existing game processing
- Score estimation uses simple formula: base (30) ± (rating_diff / 100 * 3.5)
- Confidence levels based on probability margin: High (>30%), Medium (15-30%), Low (<15%)
- Scores clamped to 0-150 range for realism

**Test Results:**
- Unit tests: 15/15 passed
- Integration tests: 14/14 passed
- Full regression: 318/318 passed
- No existing functionality broken

### File List

**New Files:**
- `tests/unit/test_predictions.py` - 546 lines (15 tests)
- `tests/integration/test_predictions_api.py` - 496 lines (14 tests)

## Technical Highlights

### Prediction Algorithm

**Win Probability:**
```
P(home wins) = 1 / (1 + 10^((away_rating - home_rating) / 400))
```

**Score Estimation:**
```
base_score = 30
score_adjustment = (rating_diff / 100) * 3.5
predicted_home_score = base_score + score_adjustment
predicted_away_score = base_score - score_adjustment
```

**Confidence Determination:**
- High: Win probability margin > 30%
- Medium: Win probability margin 15-30%
- Low: Win probability margin < 15%

### API Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/predictions?next_week=true&week=5&team_id=42&season=2025
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "game_id": 123,
  "home_team": "Georgia",
  "away_team": "Alabama",
  "predicted_winner": "Georgia",
  "predicted_home_score": 31,
  "predicted_away_score": 24,
  "home_win_probability": 68.5,
  "away_win_probability": 31.5,
  "confidence": "Medium"
}
```

### Frontend Design

**Visual Distinction:**
- Dashed border (#fafafa background)
- Yellow "PREDICTED" badge
- Blue winner highlighting
- Traffic light confidence colors
- Lighter styling vs actual results

---

## Validation & Error Handling

### Edge Cases Handled
✅ Games with missing teams (skip prediction)
✅ Teams with zero/negative ratings (skip prediction)
✅ Invalid week numbers (skip prediction)
✅ Processed games (skip prediction)
✅ Neutral site games (no home field advantage)
✅ Large rating differences (score capping)
✅ API failures (error state display)
✅ Empty results (empty state display)

### Input Validation
- Week numbers: 0-15 range
- Team ratings: Must be > 0
- Predicted scores: Clamped to 0-150
- Game status: Unprocessed only

---

## Performance Characteristics

- **API Response Time:** <100ms for 50 games
- **Frontend Load Time:** <1 second perceived
- **Database Queries:** Optimized (single query with filters)
- **Test Execution:** 327 tests complete in <10 seconds

---

## Known Limitations

### Documented Caveats
1. **Score estimates are approximate** - Based solely on ELO difference
2. **No injury/roster information** - Predictions don't account for player availability
3. **No weather/conditions** - Environmental factors not considered
4. **Historical accuracy focus** - Win probability more reliable than exact scores
5. **Early season volatility** - Ratings less stable in weeks 0-3

### When Predictions May Be Inaccurate
- Early season (weeks 0-3) - limited game data
- Major upsets - unpredictable events not modeled
- Rivalry games - emotional factors not captured
- Backup quarterbacks - roster changes not reflected
- Weather extremes - severe conditions affecting play style

---

## User Benefits

### For Fans
- **Understand matchups** before games are played
- **See which teams are favored** and by how much
- **Confidence levels** indicate certainty of predictions
- **Easy filtering** by week and team
- **Clear visual design** distinguishes from actual results

### For Analysts
- **ELO-based predictions** using proven methodology
- **Win probability percentages** for quantitative analysis
- **Confidence indicators** for prediction reliability
- **API access** for data integration

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

### Short-term Opportunities
- Add tooltip explanations for confidence levels
- Show prediction accuracy stats (requires tracking - see EPIC-009)
- Add "share prediction" feature
- Team comparison view

### Long-term Opportunities
- Incorporate offensive/defensive statistics
- Machine learning model for score prediction
- Playoff probability calculator
- User predictions (compete against system)
- Historical accuracy dashboard

---

## Integration with Existing System

### Dependencies
✅ **EPIC-006** - Current week tracking (required for "next week" filter)
✅ **Existing ELO system** - Uses Team.elo_rating field
✅ **Game model** - Uses is_processed flag
✅ **Season model** - Uses current_week field

### Enables Future EPICs
- **EPIC-009** - Prediction Accuracy Tracking (stores predictions for evaluation)
- **EPIC-010** - AP Poll Comparison (compares ELO predictions vs rankings)

---

## Deployment Status

### Production Readiness
✅ **Code Complete** - All stories finished
✅ **Tests Passing** - 327/327 tests (100%)
✅ **Documentation Complete** - Technical guide written
✅ **No Regressions** - Existing functionality unchanged
✅ **Validation Robust** - All edge cases handled
✅ **Performance Verified** - <500ms API response

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# 2. Run tests locally
pytest -v

# 3. Start development server
python3 main.py

# 4. Verify predictions endpoint
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/predictions?next_week=true" | jq

# 5. Deploy to production (when ready)
# Follow EPIC-003 deployment procedures
```

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, predictions feature can be disabled by:
1. Frontend: Hide predictions section (`#predictions-section { display: none; }`)
2. Backend: Comment out `/api/predictions` endpoint route
3. No database changes to rollback (feature doesn't modify schema)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- ELO formula worked immediately (existing algorithm reference)
- Frontend design clearly distinguishes predictions from actual results
- Validation caught several edge cases during testing
- Comprehensive testing prevented regressions

### Challenges Overcome
- Score estimation formula required tuning (base 30, adjustment 3.5)
- Confidence thresholds adjusted based on testing (30% / 15% boundaries)
- Mobile responsive design required extra CSS work
- Filter state management more complex than expected

### Best Practices Applied
- Test-driven development (wrote tests alongside code)
- Defensive programming (validate all inputs)
- Clear visual distinction (dashed borders, badges, colors)
- User feedback (loading/empty/error states)
- Documentation-first (wrote docs before finalizing code)

# Story 18.1: Redesign Rankings Page

**Status:** Draft

## Story

As a user, I want to view the rankings on a redesigned, modern page so that I can have a more engaging and intuitive experience. I also want to be able to sort and filter the rankings so that I can easily analyze the data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The main rankings page (`index.html`) is redesigned with a modern, responsive layout.
2.  The new design is visually appealing and user-friendly.
3.  The rankings table is sortable by each column (Rank, Team, Rating, Record, Conference, SOS).
4.  The rankings can be filtered by conference (P5, G5, FCS).
5.  The page is responsive and works on all major browsers and devices.
6.  Existing functionality (e.g., linking to team pages) is preserved.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories for this epic.

### Data Models

This story will primarily interact with the data returned from the `/api/rankings` endpoint. The data format is a list of objects, where each object represents a team and has the following structure:

```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "team": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Georgia",
    "conference": "P5"
  },
  "elo_rating": 1869.03,
  "record": "2-0",
  "sos": 1725.09
}
```

### API Specifications

The frontend will fetch data from the following API endpoint:

*   `GET /api/rankings`: Get the current rankings.
    *   **Query Parameters:**
        *   `season` (int, optional): The season to get rankings for.
        *   `limit` (int, optional, default: 25): The number of teams to return.

### Component Specifications

No specific component library is in use. The redesign should use modern HTML and CSS practices. The use of a lightweight CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS could be considered, but is not required. The final decision should be based on what is most appropriate for the project and easiest to maintain.

### File Locations

*   **HTML:** `frontend/index.html`
*   **JavaScript:** `frontend/js/app.js`
*   **CSS:** `frontend/css/style.css`

[Source: `docs/architecture.md#Source Tree and Module Organization`]

### Testing Requirements

*   Manual testing should be performed to ensure the new design is responsive and works on different screen sizes.
*   The sorting and filtering functionality should be tested to ensure it works correctly.
*   Existing functionality, such as links to team pages, should be tested to ensure they are not broken.

[Source: `docs/architecture.md#Testing Reality`]

### Technical Constraints

*   The frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No JavaScript frameworks are used.
*   The frontend and backend must be served from the same origin.
*   The existing API should be used as is. No changes to the backend should be made.
*   If the API call to fetch rankings fails, a user-friendly error message should be displayed on the page.

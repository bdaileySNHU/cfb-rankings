**Story ID**: STORY-002
**Epic**: EPIC-001 - Game Schedule Display
**Status**: Ready for Review
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 2-3 hours
**Agent Model Used**: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

## Story

Update the Team detail page schedule section to display the full season schedule, including both past games with results and future scheduled games.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Team schedule shows all games (completed and scheduled)
- [x] Past games display W/L with scores
- [x] Future games show "vs [Opponent]" or "TBD"
- [x] Opponent names are clickable links for all games
- [x] Location (Home/Away/Neutral) is displayed correctly for all games
- [x] No errors when schedule contains games without scores

---

## Tasks

- [x] Modify `createScheduleRow()` function in `team.js` to handle future games
- [x] Update the Result column logic to check if game has been played before showing W/L
- [x] Add "vs [Opponent]" display for future games instead of score
- [x] Ensure opponent links work for both past and future games
- [x] Handle neutral site and home/away display for scheduled games
- [x] Test schedule display with mix of completed and scheduled games

---

## Dev Notes

**Current Issue**: The `createScheduleRow()` function in `team.js` (lines 163-208) assumes all games have been played. It checks `game.is_played` but doesn't properly handle games without scores.

**Integration Points**:
- API endpoint: `GET /api/teams/{id}/schedule` (no changes needed)
- Frontend file: `frontend/js/team.js` (specifically `createScheduleRow()` function)
- Frontend file: `frontend/team.html` (table structure may need adjustment)
- CSS: Use existing `.game-scheduled` class from Story 001

**Technical Details**:
- Schedule API returns games with `is_played` boolean and optional `score` field
- Need to check both `is_played` and score existence for safety
- Table columns: Week, Opponent, Location, Result
- Future games should use grayed-out styling similar to Games page

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. [ ] Load team detail page for a team with both completed and future games
2. [ ] Verify completed games show W/L with scores
3. [ ] Verify future games show "vs [Opponent]" or appropriate placeholder
4. [ ] Test opponent links navigate correctly
5. [ ] Check browser console for JavaScript errors
6. [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Team stats (ELO rating, SOS, etc.) still display correctly
- [ ] Preseason factors section unaffected
- [ ] Navigation from rankings/teams pages still works
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Dev Agent Record

### Debug Log References
<!-- Link to .ai/debug-log.md entries if needed -->

### Completion Notes

- Refactored `createScheduleRow()` function to check `isPlayed = game.is_played && game.score`
- Applied `.game-scheduled` CSS class to future games (reused from Story 001)
- Implemented conditional styling:
  - **Played games**: Primary color, bold font for opponent links, W/L score display
  - **Future games**: Secondary color, italic styling, "vs Opponent" display
- Added `is_neutral_site` check for location display (was missing in original code)
- All links functional for both completed and scheduled games
- All 236 tests passed with no regressions

### File List

**Modified:**
- `frontend/js/team.js` - Updated `createScheduleRow()` function (lines 163-235) to handle future/scheduled games

### Change Log

---

## Files to Modify

- `frontend/js/team.js` (specifically `createScheduleRow()` and related functions)
- Potentially `frontend/team.html` (if table structure needs adjustment)

## API Reference

**GET /api/teams/{id}/schedule Response**:
```json
{
  "team_id": 3,
  "team_name": "Alabama",
  "season": 2025,
  "games": [
    {
      "week": 1,
      "opponent_id": 5,
      "opponent_name": "Georgia",
      "is_home": false,
      "is_neutral_site": false,
      "is_played": true,
      "score": "W 35-31",
      "game_date": "2025-09-01T19:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "week": 14,
      "opponent_id": 12,
      "opponent_name": "Auburn",
      "is_home": true,
      "is_neutral_site": false,
      "is_played": false,
      "score": null,
      "game_date": "2025-11-23T15:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key observations:**
- Future games have `is_played: false` and `score: null`
- Score field format for completed games: "W 35-31" or "L 28-35"
- All games include opponent info and location details

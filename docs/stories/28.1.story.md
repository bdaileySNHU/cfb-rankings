# Story 28.1: Create Developer Onboarding Documentation

**Status:** 📋 To Do
**Epic:** EPIC-028 Comprehensive Codebase Cleanup
**Priority:** High
**Risk Level:** 🟢 Zero Risk
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

## Story

As a **new developer joining the Stat-urday Synthesis project**, I want **comprehensive onboarding documentation that explains the codebase structure, development setup, and contribution workflow**, so that **I can quickly understand the system architecture and start contributing effectively without extensive hand-holding**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md created** in project root with sections:
   - Development environment setup (Python 3.11+, virtual environment, dependencies)
   - How to run the application locally (backend + frontend)
   - How to run tests (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Code contribution workflow (branching, commits, PRs)
   - Code review checklist

2. **DEVELOPMENT.md created** in project root with sections:
   - High-level architecture overview (referencing docs/architecture.md)
   - Core module responsibilities (main.py, ranking_service.py, models.py, etc.)
   - Key design patterns (dependency injection, service layer, ORM)
   - Common development tasks (adding endpoints, modifying ELO algorithm, adding tests)
   - Troubleshooting guide (common errors, solutions)

3. **Both documents use Markdown** with proper formatting, code examples, and links to relevant existing docs

4. **Documents are referenced in README.md** with a "For Developers" section linking to CONTRIBUTING.md and DEVELOPMENT.md

5. **All content is technically accurate** based on existing codebase analysis

---

## Integration Verification

- **IV1: Existing Documentation Integrity** - Verify README.md, architecture.md, and all docs/ files remain unchanged except for new "For Developers" section in README.md
- **IV2: No Code Changes** - Confirm zero changes to Python files, frontend files, or configuration files
- **IV3: Documentation Accessibility** - Verify new documentation renders correctly in GitHub and is discoverable from README.md

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This is the first story in EPIC-028. No previous stories for this epic.

**Context from Earlier Epics:**
- 26 epics completed, extensive feature development history
- Codebase has grown organically with 54 Python files in root directory
- Good high-level documentation exists (architecture.md, README.md, TESTING.md)
- Missing: formalized developer onboarding, coding standards, contribution workflow

[Source: `docs/prd.md`, `docs/EPIC-028-CODEBASE-CLEANUP.md`]

### File Locations

**New Files to Create:**
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (project root)
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` (project root)

**Files to Modify:**
- `README.md` (add "For Developers" section with links to new docs)

**Reference Documentation:**
- `docs/architecture.md` - Comprehensive system architecture
- `docs/TESTING.md` - Testing guidelines
- `docs/CI-CD-PIPELINE.md` - CI/CD workflow
- `README.md` - Current project overview

[Source: `docs/architecture.md#Source Tree and Module Organization`]

### Content Guidelines

#### CONTRIBUTING.md Should Include:

1. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Python 3.11+ requirement
   - Virtual environment setup: `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Install dev dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
   - Environment variables: Copy .env.example to .env, add CFBD_API_KEY

2. **Running the Application**
   - Backend: `python main.py` (or `python -m uvicorn main:app --reload`)
   - Frontend: Open browser to `http://localhost:8000/frontend/`
   - API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

3. **Running Tests**
   - All tests: `pytest -v`
   - Unit tests only: `pytest -m unit -v`
   - Integration tests: `pytest -m integration -v`
   - E2E tests: `pytest -m e2e -v`
   - With coverage: `pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html`

4. **Code Contribution Workflow**
   - Fork and clone repository
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/description`
   - Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "Description"`
   - Push to fork: `git push origin feature/description`
   - Open pull request to main branch

5. **Code Review Checklist**
   - All tests pass locally
   - Code follows PEP 8 style guide
   - New features have tests
   - Documentation updated if needed
   - No sensitive data (API keys, credentials) committed

[Source: `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/CI-CD-PIPELINE.md`]

#### DEVELOPMENT.md Should Include:

1. **High-Level Architecture Overview**
   - System context diagram reference (see architecture.md)
   - FastAPI backend + SQLAlchemy ORM + SQLite
   - Vanilla JavaScript frontend (no frameworks)
   - Nginx reverse proxy in production
   - CollegeFootballData API integration

2. **Core Module Responsibilities**
   - `main.py` (450 lines) - FastAPI app, all API endpoints, middleware
   - `ranking_service.py` (363 lines) - Modified ELO algorithm, business logic
   - `models.py` (146 lines) - SQLAlchemy ORM models (Team, Game, RankingHistory, Season, Prediction)
   - `schemas.py` (200 lines) - Pydantic validation schemas for API
   - `database.py` (48 lines) - DB connection, session management
   - `cfbd_client.py` (150 lines) - External API client

3. **Key Design Patterns**
   - **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI's `Depends()` for DB sessions
   - **Service Layer**: `ranking_service.py` separates business logic from API
   - **ORM Pattern**: SQLAlchemy models with relationships
   - **Repository Pattern**: Models encapsulate data access
   - **Pydantic Validation**: Automatic request/response validation

4. **Common Development Tasks**
   - Adding a new API endpoint: Add route in main.py, create schema in schemas.py
   - Modifying ELO algorithm: Edit ranking_service.py methods
   - Adding a database field: Update models.py, create migration script
   - Adding tests: Create test file in tests/, use existing fixtures
   - Importing data: Use `import_real_data.py` with CFBD_API_KEY

5. **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - **Import errors**: Check virtual environment is activated
   - **Database errors**: Delete cfb_rankings.db and run seed_data.py
   - **API call failures**: Verify CFBD_API_KEY in .env
   - **Test failures**: Check pytest markers, ensure fixtures loaded
   - **Frontend 404s**: Ensure backend running, check proxy config

### Technical Constraints

- **Documentation only** - No code changes in this story
- **Markdown format** - Use GitHub-flavored Markdown
- **Technical accuracy** - All instructions must be verified against actual codebase
- **Existing docs preserved** - Only add new docs, minimal changes to README.md
- **Clear examples** - Include code snippets and command examples

[Source: `docs/prd.md#Compatibility Requirements`]

### Testing Requirements

**Manual Verification:**
1. Render CONTRIBUTING.md in GitHub - verify formatting, links work
2. Render DEVELOPMENT.md in GitHub - verify formatting, links work
3. Verify README.md "For Developers" section appears and links work
4. Follow CONTRIBUTING.md setup instructions on fresh clone - verify accuracy
5. Verify all referenced files exist (architecture.md, TESTING.md, etc.)

**Integration Verification:**
- No code changes - use `git diff` to verify only .md files changed
- Documentation renders - check GitHub preview
- Links functional - click all cross-references

2. Verify README.md restored to original state
3. Verify CONTRIBUTING.md and DEVELOPMENT.md deleted

**Rollback Impact:** None - documentation only, no code affected

## Notes

- This story establishes the foundation for all subsequent cleanup stories
- Focus on clarity and accuracy over comprehensiveness
- Use existing docs (architecture.md, TESTING.md) as references
- Include practical examples and command-line snippets
- This is a high-value, zero-risk story - good first story for epic
